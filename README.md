# BMIN5030 Final Project

This repository contains my final project for BMIN 5030, which examines NHANES data from 2013 to 2023 to analyze trends in HPV vaccination practices and outcomes.  Specifically, this repo contains:

- BMIN5030_Final.html: This file contains the full project rendered to HTML format.
- BMIN5030_Final.qmd: This file contains the R code used to obtain, process, and analyze the data.
- This README file.

**Update 12/5/2024:**  The nhanesA R package has been removed/archived from the CRAN repository as of 11/27/24.  As a result, the .qmd file for this project, which relies on the nhanesA package to import data directly from the CDC, is not functioning properly in RStudio.  The .html file was rendered prior to the removal of nhanesA from CRAN, and still appears to be functioning as intended.
